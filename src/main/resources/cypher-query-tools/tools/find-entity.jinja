{# Tool: find_entity #}
{% if section == "description" %}
Search for an entity by name using case-insensitive partial matching.
Use this FIRST when the user mentions an entity (composer, person, work, etc.) by name.
This resolves informal or partial names to the exact entity in the database.
Returns matching entities with their IDs and full names.

If multiple results are returned, choose the most relevant one for your query.
If no results or unsatisfactory results, try again with a shorter/different search term.
{% elif section == "param_label" %}
The node label to search (e.g., 'Composer', 'Work', 'Person')
{% elif section == "param_searchTerm" %}
The search term - can be partial name, case-insensitive (e.g., 'biber', 'mozart', 'beethoven')
{% endif %}
