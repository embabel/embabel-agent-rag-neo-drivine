{# Tool: cypher_count #}
{% if section == "description" %}
Execute a Cypher query that returns a COUNT.
Use this ONLY when you need a simple count of matching nodes or relationships.

IMPORTANT: The query MUST end with: RETURN count(...) AS count
Do NOT use this for queries that return multiple columns or rows with data.
For "who has the most" or "top N" questions, use query_for_rows instead.
{% elif section == "param_cypher" %}
The Cypher query to execute. MUST return a single count value aliased as 'count'.

CORRECT examples:
- MATCH (n:Person) RETURN count(n) AS count
- MATCH (c:Composer)-[:COMPOSED]->(w:Work) WHERE c.id = 'mozart' RETURN count(w) AS count

WRONG (do NOT do this - use query_for_rows instead):
- MATCH ... RETURN c.name, count(w) AS count  -- multiple columns!
- MATCH ... WITH c, count(w) AS cnt RETURN c.name, cnt  -- multiple columns!
{% endif %}
